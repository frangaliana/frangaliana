Hi there! :wave:

I'm Fran, a Frontend Developer who builds efficient, high quality products with attention to tech details to satisfy customer or user experience and enhance your business.

Focused on clean code and good practices. I can't be without learning something new or knowing the latest.

Are you looking for help or do you think we could build a good team? You already know me a little more, so I invite you to take a look at my work or connect on one of my social networks.

Cheers,
